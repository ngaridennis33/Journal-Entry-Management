Project Overview
============================

> This repository contains two main folders: mobile and api. The mobile folder is dedicated to the mobile application, which is built using React Native with Expo. The api folder houses the backend of the application, which is developed using Express.js and TypeScript.

### Folder Structure
* mobile: Contains the React Native application developed with Expo.
* api: Contains the Express.js backend written in TypeScript.

### Mobile Application
The mobile application is developed using React Native with Expo, providing a robust and efficient framework for building cross-platform mobile apps. Expo simplifies the development process by providing a managed workflow, built-in modules, and a rich set of APIs.

### Backend API
The backend of the application is built using Express.js and TypeScript. Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. TypeScript is used to ensure type safety and improve code quality, making the backend more reliable and easier to maintain.

# Design
Below are the images of the design for both the mobile and API components.
