### Folder Structure
* mobile: Contains the React Native application developed with Expo.
* api: Contains the Express.js backend written in TypeScript.

### Mobile Application
The mobile application is developed using React Native with Expo, providing a robust and efficient framework for building cross-platform mobile apps. Expo simplifies the development process by providing a managed workflow, built-in modules, and a rich set of APIs.
and API components
### Backend API
The backend of the application is built using Express and TypeScript. Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. TypeScript is used to ensure type safety and improve code quality, making the backend more reliable and easier to maintain.
